To play RPS, the computer needs to generate an answer.
Paper beats Rock
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper

If I write  it from the user's POV, instead  of  checking  every possible combination, it starts by checking playerSelection first, then compares with computerSelection.

The basic set of functions for 1 round:
    playRound()
        getComputerChoice()
        getPlayerChoice()
        if (playerSelection === computerSelection)
            return "It's a tie. Try Again."
        else
            checkWin()
                if (playerSelection === "Rock")
                    didRockWin()
                        let rockWin = computerSelection === "Scissors" ? true : false;
                else if (playerSelection === "Paper")
                    didPaperWin()
                        let paperWin = computerSelection === "Rock" ? true : false;
                else if (playerSelection === "Scissors")
                    didScissorsWin()
                        let scissorsWin = computerSelection === "Paper" ? true : false;
        checkOutcome()
            let outcome = (isWin ? "win" : "lose");
            let winningHand = (isWin ? playerSelection: computerSelection);
            let losingHand = (isWin ? computerSelection : playerSelection);
        printOutcome()
            `You ${outcome}! ${winningHand} beats ${losingHand}.`



To create a 5-round game, I'll need  a for loop with i < 5.
Save the outcome for each in a variable. Maybe `Round ${i + 1} goes to ${roundWinner}`
    roundWinner will be dependent on outcome
        let roundWinner = whoWon()
            return outcome === "win" ? "User" : "Computer";

Use counter variables for player/computer that goes up by one when they win. After 5 games (or one side reaches 3 wins), the score that's higher is the gameWinner.
So playerScore/computerScore will be dependent on roundWinner. Then gameWinner will result from an if statement about the counters.

Variables: playerScore, computerScore, gameWinner, roundWinner,

game()
    let playerScore = 0;
    let computerScore = 0;
    for i < 5 {
        playRound()
            return outcome
        let roundWinner = whoWon(outcome)
            if (outcome === "win") {
                roundWinner = "Player"
            } else if (outcome === lose) {
                roundWinner = "Computer"
            } else {
                roundWinner = "no one"
            }
        console.log(`Round ${i + 1} goes to ${roundWinner}!`)
        if (roundWinner === "Player") {
            playerScore++
        } else if (roundWinner === "Computer") {
            computerScore++
        }
        printScores()
            console.log(`Player Score: ${playerScore}`)
            console.log(`Computer Score: ${computerScore}`)
        if (playerScore or computerScore >= 3)  {
            Exit the for loop
        }
    }
    if (playerScore > computerScore) {
        You win
    } else {
        You lose
    }
