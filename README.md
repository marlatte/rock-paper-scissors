# rock-paper-scissors
The Odin Project rock paper scissors game

My first JS game to add to my portfolio. Initial version will be played in the console, to be further revised with a  GUI as I move through those lessons.

First version is in the `original-rps.js` file.

> Hand graphics modified from [VectorStock](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/rock-paper-scissors-hand-gesture-vector-25169733).

## Future updates:

- [ ] Add intro screen with "Do you want to play a game?"
- [ ] Explain first to 5
- [ ] How to make text appear like it's being typed (i.e. letter by letter)?
- [ ] Restyle the restart button
- [ ] Mobile friendly
- [ ] Clean up images/


### Icons:
- Rock: `<i class="fa-regular fa-hand-back-fist"></i>`
- Paper: `<i class="fa-regular fa-hand"></i>`
- Scissors: `<i class="fa-regular fa-hand-scissors"></i>`

### Inspiration
- [Simple UI](https://flutterawesome.com/content/images/2022/07/Code-2022-11-58-50.jpg)
- [Buttons on bottom, progress bars on right](https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/images/large/1x/mobile-game-ui-kit-epic-rps-h62.jpg)
- [Round outcome center](https://businesscloud.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iPiccy-img-600x375.jpg)
- [Score up top?](https://img.y8.com/cloud/y8-thumbs/55340/big.gif)
- None of these _say_ "Rock Paper Scissors" on screen. Maybe for the mobile view, have that be a "welcome" modal that disappears, and for wider screens it can appear in the top left.
