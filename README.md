# Rock Paper Scissors

My first JavaScript game! The initial version was played in the console, then I added a GUI as I moved through the lessons, and later refactored again after peer-review.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Code organization
  - Before I learned about modules, this was my attempt at keeping things readable and maintainable.
  - Categorized sections as `Variables`, `Functions`, or `Event Listeners`
    - Each section is divided into `Behind the scenes` and `On-screen content` (before I knew the terms `gameController` and `screenController`).
- Refactoring
  - Initial refactoring done to give the console game a face, adding event listeners and the like to make an interactive UI.
  - After peer-review, refactored again for efficiency, responsiveness, and general UX improvements.
